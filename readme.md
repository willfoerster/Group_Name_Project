Laser Quaade is a project we are developing that adds a laser to a robot base. The goal of the project is to have a mobile laser turret that identifies targets using a camera and a Raspberry Pi Zero W. We are also using the MSP432P401R development board to control the servo legs and servo turret and to turn on and off the laser.
